## Quiz

How much do you know about formatting text elements?

Mark the following statements that are true: 

+ Avoid using the `<u>` element where it can be confused with links. 
+ It is best to use `<ins>` together with `<del>` to properly showcase text updates to a document. 
+ The `<s>` element that defined strikethrough text was deprecated in HTML 4.01, but redefined in HTML5 as text that is no longer correct. 
+  The `<s>` and `<del>` elements visually appear the same by default, but have different semantic meaning. 
- The `<del>` tag defines elements that is being delayed during the start of an animation.
