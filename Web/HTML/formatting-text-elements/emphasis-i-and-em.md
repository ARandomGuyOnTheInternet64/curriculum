`<p>`The <???>Black Pearl<???> is an <???>amazing<???> name for a pirate ship.`</p>`

When the `<em>` element is nested, what happens?

`<p>`He shouted, "`<em>`I `<em>`am`</em>` a comedian!`</em>`"`</p>`

+ Greater degree of emphasis is made on nested `<em>`s. 
+ "em > em" in CSS will style nested `<em>` elements.
+ `<em>`s and nested `<em>`s will display the exact same by default. 
- Nested `<em>`s will appear in CAPS by default.
