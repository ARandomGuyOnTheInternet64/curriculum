## Content

Some characters in HTML are reserved.  To display these characters you must replace them with character entities.

Character entities are case sensitive and are also used to display characters not present on the keyboard.

An ampersand or the "and" symbol is one of those reserved characters.

To display the ampersand symbol, you can use either the HTML entity *number* or the entity *name*.

HTML Entity Number
```
&#38;
```
Result:
```
&
```

HTML Entity Name
```
&amp;
```
Result:
```
&
```

Example:
```
<p>Get AT&amp;T free first 3 months!</p>
```
Result:
```
Get AT&T free first 3 months!
```
