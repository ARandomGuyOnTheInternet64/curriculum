## Content

In HTML the browser assumes *<* and *>* always represent the start and end of an HTML tag. If we need to display the literal characters, *<* or *>*, we must use character entities.

You can use either an HTML entity *name* or an HTML entity *number*

HTML Entity Number
```
&#60;       &#62;
```
Result:
```
 <            >
```
HTML Entity Name
```
&lt;        &gt;
```
Result:
```
 <           >
```

Example:
```
<p>Get your AT&amp;T 
free first 3 months!</p>
```
Result:
```
Get your AT&T free first 3 months!
```

## Practice

Write the code that will display this HTML tag properly: "`<p>` is an HTML paragraph tag."

???p??? is an HTML paragraph tag.
