Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attackerâ€™s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

For example, the following SQL query formed from the URL parameter `id` would be vulnerable to injection:
```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM accounts
WHERE custID = ' "
+ request.getParameter("id") +
"'";
```
Any arbitrary string passed into the `id` parameter will be executed, allowing for the creation, deletion, edit, and extraction of any information on the database. A notorious example of the SQL Injection is `"'; DROP TABLE users; --'"`; a malicious snippet which will close off the expected string, execute a command to delete the 'users' table, and finally comment out all execution after. This will render a service inoperable until backups can be restored.


Injection vulnerabilities can be prevented by **validating user input**. Before a string reaches an interpreter, special characters (like quotation marks and semicolons) should be converted to [escape characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character). Additionally, one could employ a trusted ORM-- an API that programmatically constructs SQL statements-- to ensure that validation is performed every step of the way, making injections less possible.
