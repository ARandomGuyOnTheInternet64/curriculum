## Content

Before creating or accessing a database in MongoDB, you should first start the MongoDB shell. The MongoDB shell is an interactive JavaScript shell.

To start it, you need to use the `mongo` command.
```javascript
mongo
```

After starting the shell, a series of commands will be available to you.
You can CRUD(Create, Read, Update and Delete) a database, CRUD collections and documents, and more.

You can also show available commands by typing `help`.

The `help` commands displays all the available commands you can type, including different menus like `db.help()` or `db.mycoll.help()`.

To exit the shell, you can use the `exit` command.
