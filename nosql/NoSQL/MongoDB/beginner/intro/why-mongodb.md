# Why MongoDB?
---
## Content

MongoDB is a free, open-source, document-based database. MongoDB stores documents in BSON(Binary JSON) documents. 

Those documents are schema-less and can have any number of fields and differ completely from one another. For instance, within the same collection, you can have a document with 1 field, a document with 40, and another with 12. 

MongoDB supports large amounts of data, works really fast and is easily programmable.

You can easily modify, update or delete the content of any document, collection or database at any time.

MongoDB also supports sharding, indexing, fast aggregation, and fast querying.

MongoDB is available in numerous programming languages like `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `JavaScript`, `Perl`, `Python`, `Ruby`, and more.
However, in this course, we will be using only JavaScript.
