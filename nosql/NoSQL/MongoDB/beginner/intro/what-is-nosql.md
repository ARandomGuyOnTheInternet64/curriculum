## Content

`NoSQL`, or **Not only SQL**, is any database that strays away from the traditional RDBMS model. There is no official explanation for a NoSQL database. However, there are key things most NoSQL databases share:

- Schema-less
- Polyglot persistence
- Work well on big clusters of data
- Aren't using the RDBMS

Unlike the traditional RDBMS SQL databases where you always store data in tables, there are 4 different types of NoSQL databases: Key-value, Column, Graph and Document based databases. Each of the 4 types saves data in different ways.
