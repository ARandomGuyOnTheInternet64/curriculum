# Aggregation $project
---
## Content

The aggregation pipeline `$project` stage is used to define which fields of the document/s will go into the next aggregation stage. These fields can be already existing fields or completely new ones.

This stage can be used for:
- inclusion or exclusion of a field or fields
- adding new fields
- supressing the `_id` field
- reseting values of existing fields

The syntax for `$project` is:
```javascript
{ $project: { <specification(s)> } }
```

The `<specification(s)>` can be:
```javascript
<field>: <1 or true>( to include)
<field>: <0 or false>( to exclude)
<field>: <expression>(add new field or reset existing field)
_id: <0 or false>(to exclude the _id field)
```

The `_id` field is included in the output of the aggregation by default. To exclude it, you must add `_id: 0 or false`.

For instance, let's say we wanted to aggregate the `pokemon` collection and want to only pass the `secondType` field through the next stage. We can do so like this:
```javascript
db.pokemon.aggregate( 
  [ { $project : 
      { secondType : 1} 
    } 
  ]
)
```
Output:
```javascript
{ "_id" : 72, "secondType" : "Poison" }
{ "_id" : 73, "secondType" : "Poison" }
...
```
As you can see above, our aggregation was supposed to only aggregate documents which contain the specified field(`secondType`). However, since the `_id` field is included by default we have to add `_id:0` to exclude it.
```javascript
db.pokemon.aggregate( 
  [ { $project : 
      {_id:0, secondType : 1} 
    } 
  ]
)
```
Output:
```javascript
{"secondType" : "Poison" }
{"secondType" : "Poison" }
...
```

## Practice

Which of these is a valid use case for `$project`?

???

* All 4 options
* Include fields to pass to the next pipeline stage
* Exclude fields to pass to the next pipeline stage
* Add new fields
* Reset already existing ones

---
## Revision

Add the missing pieces of code to exclude the `_id` field and only include the `type` and `power` fields in the next aggregation pipeline stage.

```javascript
db.pokemon.???( 
  [ { ??? : 
      {???:0, ??? : 1, power: ???} 
    } 
  ]
)
```

* `aggregate`
* `$project`
* `_id`
* `type`
* `1`
* `-1`
* `$match`
* `$group`
