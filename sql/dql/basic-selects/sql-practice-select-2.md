# SQL Practice Select

---        
## Exercise

Click *Launch Exercise* to open SQLFiddle. Run *Build Schema*. This creates and populates the Pokemon database.

Next, click *Run SQL* and observe the output.

Now, alter the query (in the right-hand window) to return the `name`, `height` and `weight` of all members of the `pokemon` table.

Click *Run SQL* again. Then click *link* in the green bar below the output. This will update the URL in the address bar of your browser. Copy the new URL to submit with your answer.

In the answer field, enter the name, height, and weight of the Pokemon listed in the top row.

Example: `fakemon, 1000, 29`
